    <h1> how I would go about losing weight in 2026</h1>
    <p>

      I have been going to the gym coming about 3 years consistently. If you are having a hard time trying to lose
      weight I feel like I have a good grasp on how to approach losing weight. I wont say I have the best credentials
      considering I completed a "successful cut" one time throughout those entire 3 years where I managed to lose
      23.6lbs in 70 days but I'm having a good flow going now for this summer.

    </p>
    <p>
      First thing is to determine your total daily energy expenditure(tdee). Its a fancy way of saying figure out how
      much calories your body may spend in a day. These calculators are all over the internet and I wont say they are
      particularly accurate but its a good starting point for what we are about to do next.
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously to lose weight, and in this case our main goal is to lose fat, is to be in a caloric deficit. In most
      tdee calculators it can give you a caloric goal that should cause you to lose weight.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to take this number and eat at this deficit for two weeks. The main goal of this is to watch how your
      weight changes over this period. To determine if this deficit is working we need to be weighing in daily. Weighing
      daily will help make sure that you are losing weight in the grand scheme of things and can help you make
      adjustments to your caloric deficit depending scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to be tracking your calories. I find that keeping track of your calories not only keeps you mindful of
      what you are eating but can also open your eyes to how much you may you be eating.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are tracking your calories and eating within you caloric deficit. You should see some sort of change in
      your weight. If you notice that you aren't losing weight after a week, that is where you would either, decrease
      your calories by at least 100 or do more cardio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly I would recommend increase your daily steps. Most modern mobile phones provide a way to track your steps
      and I would take a look at that. If you aren't walking more than 5000 steps daily, I would recommend to
      try and aim for 8000 steps and ultimately trying to reach 10000 steps. These are just arbitrary numbers but for
      your long term health, just try and walk more daily and it will benefit you in more ways than one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Staying hydrated is a given. Dont skip this please.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you havent started weight training, I would recommend starting. It will help build and maintain muscle
      throughout this process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding your tdee, tracking your calories, and walking more are the bare minimum when it comes to
      trying to lose weight. Dont start off too harsh in your deficit and in trying to walk more. You will most likely
      burn out and the main goal is to stay consistent.

    <h2>tips that helped me</h2>
    <p>
      What I stated above is something probably ai could have said better but ai lacks real experience like myself hehe.
      The things that Im about to go over now are tips that helped me lose weight.

    </p>
    <p>
      Your environment matters immensely. If you have a bunch of random snacks like chips, candy, cereal, etc. Basically
      anything that is easy to grab and eat is setting you up for failure. I would refrain from purchasing anything of
      that nature because it is so easy to binge eat these items and it will leave you feeling worse in the end.

    </p>
    Please begin cooking for yourself. It a great skill to have, I wont even say Im great cook myself either. Cooking
    your own meals will leave you more satiated then any fast food place ever will and you will also save money. Use
    cooking spray that is 0 calories.

    <p>
      If I had to recommend some sort of foods to cook or buy, it would be as simple as sorting them into protein ,fats,
      and carbs. For proteins I would buy just any sort of your favorite lean meat. Chicken breast ,chicken tenderloins
      ,chicken thighs, 90 10 beef, 93 7 beef, 96 4 beef, tuna, salmon, and turkey bacon are all good choices. Salt and
      pepper is really all you need but any other spices that aren't calorically dense are fine as well. Eggs are a
      great protein and fat source and would always prefer it over egg whites. As for your carb intake oats, potatoes
      ,and sweet potatoes are a god send. You can put potatoes into a microwave for 5 minutes, salt and pepper on
      top, and then some low calorie sauce and it taste amazing. Don't forget your veggies, frozen vegetables are your
      best bet as it saves time. Protein powder helps too, I like to put it into my oats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Low calories sauces and zero calorie sodas come in clutch. My favorite is sugar free baby rays and coke zero. The
      more diet soda you drink you should up your water intake and be careful drinking lots of diet sodas as they are
      actually pretty high in caffeine depending on the drink.

    </p>
    <p>
      Refrain from liquid calories. The goal when trying to lose weight is to not be hungry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cutting out foods that you may enjoy entirely out of your diet will probably lead to you binge eating. Its best to
      try and squeeze some of your favorite foods into your meal plan. For me, I like to eat a bagel and some cream
      cheese everyday. Keeps me sane. You can even slide in cereal or snacks but its very risky to have these items just
      even near you and its probably best to cook something that you enjoy eating.
    </p>

    <p>
      If trying to eat out with friends and family is sort of an issue. I recommend looking at the menu before hand and
      try and choose something that is macro friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weighing your food is majorly important and goes hand in hand with tracking your calories. Weighing your food will
      accurately let you know how much calories you are actually consuming. When it comes to when you should weigh your
      food, just go ahead and search it up. Most meats lose weight after being cooked so its best to weigh it after you
      cook the meat. Anything that probably wont lose or gain weigh after you prepare it is fine to weight as is.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't get discouraged at the scale. Weight fluctuates daily and you should rather look at your weight over an
      entire week for a more realistic view of your weight change. I find it best to just get on the scale and once the
      scale tracks your weight get off and forget about it. I recommend getting one of them scales that connect to your
      phone and automatically records your weight. Unless you go analog that is also fine but we want to make this
      process as easy as possible. The more friction you have in the process of trying to lose weight the more likely
      you are to just quit as its just to much work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not sponsored but macro factor is what got me to lose 23lbs. Its an investment that I thought was a small
      sacrifice in the grand scheme of losing weight. Provides an easy way to track your calories and the app gives
      adjustments to your deficit based on your weight over time are just a few of the features that it provides. Take a
      look if it sounds interesting.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I really thought this would be shorter and its my first post so bear with me. If I had to condense everything Id
      say figure out your tdee, eat at a deficit, weigh yourself daily, cook for your self, make sure your environment
      works for
      you(no snacks etc),track calories and weigh your food ,drink water, and get enough sleep. Remember that you are
      loved and thanks for reading.
